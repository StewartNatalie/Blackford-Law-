        Workers Compensation 
        </h3>
        <p>
        Your workplace should prioritize your health and wellness. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Workplace injuries can have long-lasting effects, especially if you don't have adequate medical care. Neglecting even minor injuries can lead to future health problems, high medical bills and an inability to work. It's your employer's responsibility to ensure that you are taken care of until you're fully recovered: that you get the right medical treatment and an appropriate settlement to cover your medical bills. 
        </p>
        <p>
        You don't deserve to be in pain. Being a good employee means taking care of yourself first, and powerful representation will make sure the law is on your side.

        Healthcare and Compensation: Your Legal Right To Recovery
        </h3>
        <p>
        Healthcare is expensive. You have a right to free healthcare and settlement funds.
        If you've hurt yourself at work, and thought it was best to work through the pain, you're not alone. Employers may try to bully you for reporting injuries that weren't your fault. Some employers threaten retaliation or termination. 
        </p>
        <p>
        But you have a legal right to protect your health and safety.
        And ignoring workplace injures can cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical expenses and can compromise your ability to work longterm.
        You were there for your employer... it's time they provide compensation and healthcare, including medication, vitamins, health supplements, chiropractic visits and physical therapy.

        If you are injured on the job, you have the right to:
        </p>
        <p>
            - Treatment by a competent medical professional
        </p>
        <p>
            - Funds to cover 66% of your income until you can return to work
        </p>
        <p>
            - Continued treatment for your injury for life, and even more depending on the circumstances
        </p>
        <p>
        Your employer has a team of legal professionals protecting their rights, it's important to have a team on your side. And don't worry about the cost: claims are free for the injured worker, and we don't get paid unless you do.
