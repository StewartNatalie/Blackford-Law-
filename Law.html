                <h2>
                Employment Law 
                </h2>
                <p>
                Whether it's an office or a jobsite, you have the right to equitable wages and fair treatment. There are federal laws in place to protect you from unwelcome behavior at work: you're not alone.
                Employment law covers wage theft, harassment, discrimination, a hostile work environment, retaliation and more. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                Wage Theft
                </h3>
                <p>
                If your employer has neglected to pay you all of your rightfully owed wages and benefits, we can help you get that income back.    
                When employers violate minimum-wage laws, misclassify employees as independent contractors, make illegal pay deductions, fail to pay annual leave or vacation days, or don't pay an employee for every minute worked, they are complicit in wage theft.
                </p>
                <h3>
                Harassment
                </h3>
                <p>
                Workplace harassment is unwelcome, discriminatory behavior from superiors or co-workers that is based on gender, pregnancy status, nationality, ethnic background, age, religion, disability or sexual orientation. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                Discrimination
                </h3>
                <p>
                Workplace discrimination is unacceptable, and there are federal anti-discrimination laws in place for your protection. 
                <h3>
                Hostile Work Environment
                </h3>
                <p>
                Are you unable to do your job because of a hostile atmosphere at work? If you're being treated so badly that you are unable to do your job, you have a right to legal assistance.
                </p>        
                <h3>
                Retaliation
                </h3>
                <p>
                Federal law protects you from workplace retaliation. You are legally exempt from retaliatory punishment and termination for: whistle blowing, filing a complaint, participating in a lawsuit, resisting sexual interest, inquiring about other employee salaries, requesting special consideration for religious practices, asking for allowances due to a disability, refusing to discriminate against others and protecting other employees who are, or would be, victims of unwelcome behavior.

                Workers Compensation 
                </h2>
                <p>
                Your workplace should prioritize your health and wellness. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Workplace injuries can have long-lasting effects, especially if you don't have adequate medical care. Neglecting even minor injuries can lead to future health problems, high medical bills and an inability to work.
                You shouldn't put yourself at risk of illness or injury, especially during the current Covid19 pandemic. 
                </p>
                <p>
                If you are injured on the job, you have the right to:
                </p>
                <p>
                - Treatment by a competent medical professional
                </p>
                <p>
                - Funds to cover 66% of your income until you can return to work
                </p>
                <p>
                - Continued treatment for your injury for life, and even more depending on the circumstances
                </p>
                <p>
                Your employer has a team of legal professionals protecting their rights, it's important to have a team on your side. 
                Claims are free for the injured worker and we don't get paid unless you do.
                </p>
